# Toils & Troubles

![logo](https://github.com/mortoray/toils-and-troubles/blob/master/Assets/logo.png)

A simple repeating task management app.


## Tasks Page

The "Tasks" page shows the tasks that currently need to be done. Use the filter at the top of the page to limit to items that need to be completed within the given time.

Click on the checkmark to mark the task complete. If the task needs to be done multiple times a counter will appear and decrement each time.


## Setup Page

The "Setup" page allows editing and creation of tasks.

Swipe left to reveal a "Delete" option.


## Config Page

This will house options, like notifications, eventually. For now it is blank.


### Debug

The debugging menu allows loading from sample tasks as well as incrementing the current time (to test that tasks renew themselves).
